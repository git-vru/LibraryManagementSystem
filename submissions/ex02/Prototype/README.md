# How to install the prototype

1. Download the source code or clone the project via ssh or https.
2. Open IntelliJ (because it's the only IDE we are working with, and we are sure it works with it).
3. Open the prototype (```src/```) folder in IntelliJ. ⚠️ NOT THE WHOLE REPOSITORY FOLDER
4. Wait for Gradle to install properly.

## Run the prototype
1. Go in the main file (```src/main/java/Main.java```) and click on the first green play button, then the first option ```Run 'Main.main()'```.

## Execute the test
1. Go in test file (```src/test/java/controller/ControllerTest.java```) and click on the first green play button, then ```Run ControllerTest```.

## Troubleshooting

- If the green button doesn't appear or you can't run the program, please make sure that you open the right folder.
  The root folder must be ```src```.
- If the problem persists, please check your JDK version and your Gradle version.
